				Background Info: I am an Australian citizen and I follow the Islam culture. My education up to date would be Kindergarten to Y12 to 2 Courses in UNI related to IT not including this current course. I speak English and understand a little bit of Arabic because of my family speaking it often. I draw and read every now and then, fitness as of recently and I play games whenever I have free time.

		<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Interest in IT</h1></div> 
		<div class="sectionContent">
				<p> I’ve been interested in IT for a while now, however if I were to pinpoint what my interest in IT would be it would be being able to create something from basically nothing accept the tools required. Tools like HTML, C++, Python, App creation etc. I became interested in IT a little before I finished my final year of high school, when I was really trying to figure out what I’d enjoy to study for UNI. 
				</p>
				<p> I first became interested in IT because I had grown up around it, knowing what to do with them but not knowing how they work. My interest in IT sparked because of my mother mostly as she would talk to me about how some of the IT around us worked, thus sparking my interest. My experience in IT would be that I’ve done a Cyber Security course, Basics to Programming and now I’m doing Introduction to IT. 
				</p>
				<p> I’ve decided to take the courses Intro to IT and programming with RMIT because I’ve seen many positive reviews on how the course is conducted as well as being able to do it online, making it more convenient than having to go in person. When signing up/enrolling for the course I was hoping to be able to learn a broad and more basic scope of learning so that I can get a better idea on what I’d like to delve deeper into as a career.

		<div class="sectionContent">
				<h2>Project Manager/Engagement Manager</h2>
				<p>My ideal job (Project/Engagement Manager) is varying on pace depending on what will be worked on.  It could be in a big group or a small group depending on which company or if I decide to make to company myself and take on the role. The main objective of this role is to manage the group and assign the people to what they could do best on as most people are better at some things and worse on others.  Another sub role of this job would be to maintain relationships mainly customer relationships or share holder relations with the goal of improving our products continuously as the IT industry is ever changing. Project/Engagement Manager is appealing to me as I enjoy managing/working in a group and finding solutions for better work cohesion along with my love for IT.
				</p>

				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>The job requires an 8+ year experience in management and service delivery (as seen on the indeed advert). 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Skills required for the job are working experience relating to management and presenting the start to finish products in the IT section. I currently don’t have any experience in the work place or in regard to management.  </li>
					<li>Solid technical background with understanding and/or hand-on experience in software delivery. This skill simply means that the person applying needs to have experience with successful software delivery, which I do not have currently.   </li>
					<li>Excellent written and communication skills in regard to dealing with clients and fellow co-workers which of course I would need to be in more groups and gain more experience while working with other groups. Written skills can be improved by reading up on the writing skills of accomplished people in regard to any field. </li>
					<li>Organizational skills are required for the job, I believe I’m nearly there I simply need to be able to take on more work and follow that plan after organizing and managing more people. This skill can only be improved by being involved with more organizational tasks.  </li>
					<li>The ability to work with multiple types of tools such as word, excel, power point, etc. which I would be able to learn more of simply by either watching videos on a more detailed guide of all of these tools and or a tutorial from more experienced users such as seniors in the workplace.  </li>
					<li>Being able to negotiate well internally and externally in regards to the project being worked on, whether it is the plans, initiatives, analysis, problem solving so on and so forth. Having been in only a few groups as of my current career being only in high school and outside of school, a solution to being able to improve my negotiation skills are thinking back on previous negotiation situations and think on what could be best for both sides.  </li>
					<li>Understanding accounts payable processes and accounting. I do not have any experience with accounts payable processes or accounting, which can be fixed by research. If this solution doesn’t help going through a simple course and or asking someone to teach you is a good way to learn about it.  </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The plan would be to actually learn all the sub areas of the job being PMP or Prince II or similar. Most of the things related to this job are correlating to experience, so the more work I do in each field the more experience I gain in regard to the specific topic. However where I go to learn/build upon these new skills are not entirely dependent on where I go accept for a few of the skills; Such as the presentation of products as they would be directly related to IT. So it would be best to try and get an internship to learn from a manager relating to the job for a more detailed learning experience. To become effective at negotiation it would be best to learn more of both sides and think of the best possible outcome for both parties (the company and customer or co-worker and boss etc).  To become more experienced/learn more about accounts payable processes and accounting would be best to learn from professionals which would be best done either through a course at a UNI that specializes in such. In regard to becoming experienced to Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc. would be to do research and do exercises on each specific tool.

		<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Personal Profile</h1></div>
		<div class="sectionContent">
				<ul>
					<li>Myers-Briggs test - Mediator</li>
					<li>Online learning style test – Visual ISTJ (Introverted Sensing Thinking Judging) learner</li>
					<li>The Big 5 test – 639d476aeb231b0008395a52 (The ID)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These results don’t particularly mean anything to me because I know how I’d eventually act while I’m within a group. However I do agree that I’m somewhat a mediator that the Briggs test showcased in that I enjoy fixing bad situations to increase worker cohesion and efficiency. I do also believe that they just create very broad results to get as many people to agree with them.
				</p>
				<p>I do not think that they’d influence how I’d think in a team, I do hope it doesn’t influence how others think while in a team as the person themselves should know how they are in a group in regard to how well they perform and what they are good at.  For e.g. a Mediator could be a very good leader because of their experience in groups or they could be something completely different because of how they grew up or other situations, even their current situation could impact how they are in a group.
				</p>
				<p>In regards to relating these results to forming a team; they should not be used to form a team at all as forming a team shouldn’t made based on results that might not be accurate as just simply getting to know your team and finding out what they find easy or hard or what they excel at. As a result of a talking with your team and allocating roles based on what they are good it increases the communication and efficiency of the team, making you as a leader or group member more trust worthy.

		<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Project Idea</h1></div>
		<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>The idea that I’ve decided I’d like to go with is a free to download stress/ anxiety App/Website that runs in the background of whatever device you would be using to decrease work stress or anxiety utilising brainwaves that soothe the mind while you work not having to worry about how you feel about your work. This app may also be used for people that have work related stress or anxiety that need help regarding to work. Therefore, the main goal for this app or website (to be decided) is to lower work stress or anxiety.
			</p>
			<p>I’ve decided to go with this project idea because as of recently Australia has suffered a rise of stress in a work environment reaching 73% all together; which is an insurmountable amount in regard to the work force being such an integral part of our society, being parents, teenagers, adults so on and so forth. The main reason I had decided I wanted to do this idea is because I constantly hear from friends, my parents or fellow co workers about work stress and anxiety. Thus, an app that helps prevent that seemed like a great idea.
			</p>
			<p>How does stress occur? Stress occurs when someone needs to meet the demands made of them that exceeds that individuals ability to cope with the situation which is basically your body being put into high gear to cope with the additional work. The app seems to be an interesting project because if it’s possible to reduce stress through the use of brain waves, music or whatever is needed to reduce the 73% to anything lower it would help a lot with the main bulk of our workforce in Australia. This app/website would include a section where it’s possible to play sounds or music that accommodate to stress or anxiety most likely being able to increase based on how stressed you feel in regards to the work that has been placed on you which has been testing scientifically, specifically being called “Delta, Theta, Alpha, Gamma Waves” all helping solve different problems. The app may be used for stress all around whether it is for work stress, help study more efficiently, sleeping more soundly(REM Sleep), or simply every day stress which could include stress from family or stress from friends. Another of the waves that have been found is the BETA waves that help with focus, high level cognition while also being able to stimulate energy and action in the brain. All of these sounds and frequencies will be implemented into the app labelled differently so that everyone utilising it will know exactly what they seek for, whether it be for deep sleep, pain relief, stress reduction or anything similar that the app includes. Another feature would be to either queue up a frequency or to set it to replay if you will be doing work or takes you long to sleep.
Another feature that I’d like to include would be a comment section all labelled differently and anonymously so that everyone can share what they want while also asking questions on their current situation whether it be to ask what other people have done while going through this situation of what works and what doesn’t work. This section in the app would greatly help other people not involved in the situation currently as it could appear in the near future which would be helping to deal with present and future problems. 
			</p>
			<p>The main programming languages that I’d hope to be used would be HTML for the website. HTML is the Hypertext Mark up Language that is typically used to create websites. As for the app Swift/Objective C would be used depending on what the final decision will be on what platform it will be released on. Swift is an open source programming language that was released 2014 that allows users to make apps. The technology or other tools required to make the desired frequencies for the specific user however each frequency can be already found online which would be simply just implemented into the APP/Website. 
			</p>
			<p>The HTML coding and or Swift/ObjectiveC coding needs to be written depending. No special hardware or any hardware besides a computer or a laptop will be needed involved in this project as everything is online. To learn these skills would be incredibly easy as there are free and paid tutorials online on a various amounts of difficulty of HTML or Swift while HTML and Swift are also free to use making the feasibility extremely easy to fulfil. As there is no hardware required it makes the project a lot more feasible than if hardware was involved. Thus the skills required for this project are simple and barely need much to function.
			</p>
			<p>The main hope of the project is to reduce stress/anxiety in regards to work from the 73% that it has been raised to however this could also be used for stress overall as everyone experiences stress and the solution for the app or website would be sounds that calm down the brain or parts of the brain that. The app will also be used for other purposes such as sleep, study or anything else that the app will acquire in the future. Thus the app I believe is interesting and fun to be able to look into.
